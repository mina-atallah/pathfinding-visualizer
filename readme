# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Overview

This is a **Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer** that allows you to see how pathfinding algorithms work on a grid. You can set up start and end points, place obstacles (walls), and watch the algorithm find the shortest path.

## Features

- **Place Start and End Nodes**: Set the starting and ending nodes on the grid.
- **Place Walls**: Add obstacles that block the algorithm’s path.
- **Run Pathfinding Algorithm**: Execute an algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the end.
- **Reset Grid**: Clear the grid and start fresh.

## Algorithms

    - Currently, **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** is supported. This algorithm finds the shortest path between the start and end points on the grid, avoiding obstacles.
    - BFS and DFS will be added.

## How to Use

1. **Place Start and End Nodes**:

   - Click the **Place Start Node** button and click on the grid to set the start node.
   - Click the **Place End Node** button and click on the grid to set the end node.

2. **Place Walls**:

   - Click the **Place Walls** button.
   - Click on the grid where you want to place walls (obstacles).

3. **Run the Algorithm**:

   - After placing the start and end points, click the **Run Algorithm** button after selecting the one exists to see how the algorithm finds the shortest path.

4. **Reset the Grid**:
   - Click the **Reset** button to clear the grid and start over.
